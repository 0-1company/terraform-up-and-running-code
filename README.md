# Terraform: Up & Running Code

This repo contains the code samples for the book *[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* by 
[Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).

## Quick start

All the code is in the [code](/code) folder. It is organized by language (terraform, bash, ruby, etc) and within each
language, by chapter. Since this code comes from a book about Terraform, the vast majority of the code consists of
Terraform examples in the [code/terraform folder](/code/terraform). 

For instructions on running the code, please consult the README in each folder, and, of course, the 
*[Terraform: Up and Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com)* book.
